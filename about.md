# About Me

I am a Computer Engineering student at **RWTH Aachen University**, combining studies in **AI systems** and **embedded computing** with cross-cultural leadership through **EESTEC**.

My academic focus lies in designing intelligent, efficient systems while contributing to international student communities that bridge technology and social impact.  

Fluent in **English (C2)** and **German (C2)**, native in **Turkish**, and currently advancing **French** to C1/C2 level at Institut Français Aachen.  

My long-term goals include obtaining a **Fulbright scholarship** and pursuing graduate studies at an Ivy League university, with a focus on innovation and global collaboration.
